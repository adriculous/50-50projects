# Projects from "50 Projects in 50 Days" 50 Projects in 50 Days
This is a repo of all my 50 Projects created from the Udemy course [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. The projects can also be used for references to build future sites, as well as modifying them for my future portfolio items. I enrolled in this course as part of my #100DaysOfCode ongoing challenges.

## Project Demos
The demos for these 50 projects are available in my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/adriculous-the-looper). List will be updated as projects are completed in chronological order.
